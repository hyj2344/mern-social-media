Build a social media website like Facebook. One can sign up by filling information and uploading a picture. After login, user can publish a post with text, picture or video.  All posts are displayed on the home page. Users can “like” someone’s posts but only add comments to friends’ post. To be a friend of someone, a user needs to make a request. By approving a friend request, new friend’s name is added into the friend list which is shown on the user’s main page. 
The technologies used are Node.js, Express, React with MUI.

first, request a friend, then approved or deny a friend request.
User can upload a video.
One can add comments to only his/her friends'posts.
